An experimental software build system.

I'm thinking about combining several new developments in software technology and experimenting with how they can provide a system for building software.

* containerisation for isolating build steps
* overlay file systems for collecting and examining build output
* snapshots for storing and arching build output

Ideas and inspirations taken from the following open source projects:

* git
* btrfs
* docker
* ostree

In memory of Peter Miller, friend, mentor and software build system aficionado.
